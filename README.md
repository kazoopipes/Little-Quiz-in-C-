# Little-Quiz-in-C++
This is just a simple quiz I made in C++! I know my code is pretty bad, so you don't need to tell me :)

basically what the file does is get the user to edit varieables and then runs them through an if statement.
if the answer is correct it changes a boolean to equal true
and if its wrong it changes a boolean to equal false
then at the end the booleans are put through an if statement that turns it into a score out of 3
feel free to tell me how i can improve in the comments or if there is a way to reduce the lines of codem or make it simpler.
enjoy! :D
